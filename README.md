# CHD Risk Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk using various data science techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) models. The project leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and advanced statistical methods to forecast the risk of CHD based on various health-related factors.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build predictive models that can estimate the risk of Coronary Heart Disease based on a dataset of relevant health metrics. The following steps were undertaken:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Development and Evaluation**

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models including logistic regression and decision trees.

## Project Details

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- **Dataset**: [Provide details about the dataset used, including source, size, and features.]
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Scaling and normalizing data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
